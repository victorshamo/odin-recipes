# odin-recipes

This is simple project is part of the Odin Project curriculum.

I've created a simple website with a few recipes on it. 
The ideia was to use only HTML, by adding a few images, links, paragraphs, and headers.

We have also been encouraged to use Git to commit our changes during this project.
