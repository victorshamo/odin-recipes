# odin-recipes

This is a simple project that is part of the Odin Project Foundations curriculum.

I've created a simple static website with a few recipes on it. 
The idea was to use only HTML, by adding a few images, links, paragraphs, and headers.

I've added a few basic lines of CSS to test our basic knowledge.

We have also been encouraged to use Git to commit our changes during this project.
